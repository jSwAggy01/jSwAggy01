### Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! 👋

My name is Jason and I'm a recent graduate from the University of California, Riverside. I'm a mathematician by trade but I've grown quite fond of programming over the years, so much so that it has developed into a vested interest of mine.

Below you'll find a couple of tidbits about me, and further down you will find 'pinned' repositories of projects that I have completed throughout my programming career! I'm always working on something, so please feel free to stop by to see what I'm up to.

🔭 Currently I'm:
- Building a full-stack data analytics project.
- Self-studying data science and AI to further my long-term goal of becoming an ML expert.

⚡ Work experience:
<!--- **IT Specialist (incoming) at Stealth Startup** - Software engineer enhancing the training for over 100k students throughout the country via the use of digital instruction and VR simulation (est. Summer 2025).-->
- **IT Intern at San Bernardino County** - Computer specialist overseeing the large-scale infrastucture of a county-wide collection of digital system-related issues (Fall 2023).

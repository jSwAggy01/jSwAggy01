### Helloo!  ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jason and I'm a recent graudate from the University of California, Riverside. I'm a mathematician by trade but I've grown quite fond of programming over the years, so much so that it has developed into a vested interest of mine. Here's some things about me!

ðŸ”­ Currently I'm:
- Writing documentation for all of my past projects and uploading them here!
- Pursuing my GIS and AWS certification.
- Exploring online machine learning opportunities to further my goal of becoming an ML engineer.

âš¡ Work experience:
- **Information Technology Intern at San Bernardino County** - Computer specialist overseeing the large-scale infrastucture of a county-wide collection of digital system-related issues (San Bernardino, Fall 2022).

ðŸŒ± Interests:
- Virtual reality
- Speech recognition

ðŸ’¬ I'm reachable via email or LinkedIn! jasondeleon2432@gmail.com | www.linkedin.com/in/jasondeleon2432
